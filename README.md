# cs50-final
Final project for cs50. A nice little tool to calculate what city two people should meet in using air travel.

Written in Python. Fun times!
Requires requests.

Complete credit for the airports DB given to OurAirports.com, who do a great job compiling airport information (and release it into the public domain!)
